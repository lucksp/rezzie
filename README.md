# Simple Reservation System

## To Run app:

-   Basic assumption: `npm`, `node > 10` is already installed.

1. clone repo.
2. Install dependencies: run `npm install` after cloning repository.
3. Run the app: `npm start`
4. Browser will automatically optn to http://localhost:1234/

## Notes about the app:

-   Create a reservation: Only from 3pm - 10pm, available in 15 minute increments.
-   Party size between 1-5 guests
-   Guest details: Only the name is required.
-   If reservation exists, you can click it to view the details.

    -   _Missing requirement: implementation of 1 hour block is not perfect._

-   Styling: virtually no customization at this time.
